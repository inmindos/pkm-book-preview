The PKM Flywheel's second part is management of your collected knowledge. This involves going through your notes regularly. You have to set a recurring task to open your vault and go through some of the notes. You have multiple things you can do here...

- Read - refresh your memory about the topic.
- Add - add new notes when doing a review.
- Update - update some of your notes with things you newly learned.
- Link - add new connections between notes.
- Delete - there might be some content within a note, or an entire note, that needs to be deleted. It might not be relevant, or you might have found that that note is inaccurate. Deleting information is a part of the process.

Each time you open the vault and just browse around, reading notes, pruning information, you are adding another rotation to the flywheel. This is what gives it momentum. You'll get work done using this flywheel only if it has this momentum. And that is why this part of the process is critical.

Another helpful way of thinking about this part is to think of it as managing a garden. If the [[060 - Capture]] section is planting, the Manage section is tending to it. Watering it, removing the weeds, pruning, re-poting, etc. This will have to be done regularly to have a well maintained garden. Also, this is the reason why a published PKM system is called a Digital Garden.

The importance of this part is often missed by beginners. In capture, the number of notes increases - there is a very visible outcome. But in the management part, the outcome is much less visible. It will make a change only after a while - when those changes accumulate.

## Habit: Vault Walk

Once a week, open up your vault, go to the graph view. Look at your knowledge base. See the connection between ideas. Maybe search for keywords from a problem you are facing. 

Open up a few notes. Read it. See if you have any new insight about that topic. Pass this information once again thru your mind, see if it hits any other information your mind is already holding.

After a while, you'll see this happening. 

## Actions

These are the different things we can do during a vault walk...

### Decide Notes to Review

You will not be able to go through all notes you have every time you review. You need to select which notes you want to review. 

Graph view is a useful tool to help you decide. Most PKM tools have a graph view - its a page that shows how the notes are linked to each other in a graphical way. This is how it looks like in Obsidian...

![[web-of-ideas.png]]

You can use these lenses to decide which all notes to review...

- Find notes related to your currently active projects
- Notes around the topics you are currently studying
- Notes that are under construction. You might have a tag for such notes(mine is `#todo`).
- Find orphan notes(notes not connected to any other notes). Use the Graph View to find these.
- Find junction notes(notes that connect to many notes). Graph View, again.

### Read/Reflect

Your first action should be just to go through the note. Take it into your mind. Think about it. This part is important enough to warrant its [[Read Reflect|own chapter]].

One of the purpose of going through the vault is so that we have a better representation of the vault in our mind. We need to know what our vault has. We might not remember exactly what the notes says, but we will at least know that we have a note about it. Even better if you have a rough idea of what the note says. The more times we go through our vault, the more you will see this happen. This action is what transforms the information in your vault into knowledge in your mind.

### Add

When you go through the vault, you might find missing notes. A topic you linked out to, but never created. Create that note.

### Update

You can add new details to an existing note. Chances are you have learned something new about that topic since you created the note. This your chance to add those details to the note.

### Link

You might see a connection to another note that you didn't see when creating the note. There might be new notes that you can link out to now - that weren't there when you created the note. Create these links.

### Delete

You might find information within a note  or an entire note itself that no longer adds value. You should delete those. There can be many reasons for this - information might be wrong, or no longer relevant, etc. You should delete such information.

PS: This is not easy. I find it very hard to delete things(yes, I'm a data hoarder). But there is value in deleting unnecessary things.

### Organize

Examine the tags - add/remove them as needed. If you are using a folder structure, see if its in the correct folder. If not, move it to the right folder.

- See if you can think of different ways of representing the information
    - Create an info graphic?
- Reflect
    - Spend some time intentionally thinking about what you are going thru.
    - Use these questions - they will bring more richness to the idea. This comes from the [Zettelkasten Compass](https://feeei.substack.com/p/the-essence-of-the-zettelkasten-method#%C2%A7the-compass-of-zettelkasten-thinking) Framework
        - Where does this idea come from?
            - what are its origin?
            - what group/category does X belong to?
            - what exists an order of magnitude higher? zoom out.
            - what gave birth to X?
            - what causes X?
        - What other ideas are similar to this idea?
            - what other disciplines could X already exist in?
            - what other disciplines could benefit from X?
            - what are other ways to say/do X?
        - Where can this idea lead to?
            - what does X contribute to?
            - what group/category could X be the headline of?
            - what exists an order of magnitude lower? zoom in.
            - what does X nurture?
        - What competes with this idea?
            - what is the opposite of X?
            - what is X missing?
            - its disadvantages?
            - what could supercharge X?
- Synthesise
    - Combine content together to create new content.
- Organize
    - Verify the information
    - See if it connects with the new information that you got.
    - Is there any other way to interpret this?
- Use other frameworks
    - Create Anki cards/flash cards
