PKM Flywheel is the loop of action that you have to repeat every time you get new information.

But after each rotation of the flywheel you are charging it up. It gets more power every time you put in another loop. When you put in more information into the system.

---

the amount of energy, or momentum, your flywheel contains depends on three things:

1.  How fast you spin it
2.  How much friction there is
3.  How big it is

Its so powerful that there is a company called spin launch trying to use a flywheel to send rockets to space.

Friction
- Friction in adding
- Friction in deciding where to add. What tags, which folders.
- Find is difficult if not categorized properly.

Another way of doing this is the Encode Framework...
- Encounter: Encounter an idea
- Note: Make a quick, fleeting note.
- Connect: Connect the idea to your existing knowledge.
- Organize: Tag/Categorize - find how this idea fits into your knowledge graph.
- Develop: Add your own thoughts and questions to the idea
- Express: Write the permanent note your own words
