PKM, or Personal Knowledge Management, is one of the most under-rated skills you can learn. If you get better at PKM, it will improve all areas of your life. You have to keep using and reusing your existing knowledge - **the better you are at capturing and reusing knowledge, the better your life will be**.

This is especially true if you are a knowledge worker. Their ability to do their jobs will depend on the knowledge they have. Examples of this include programmers, content creators, lawyers, doctors etc. 

Even though this is a critical skill, it is criminally neglected by most people. Other than a few instructions to take notes at school, or a marginally useful way to memorize things, we have not been taught about PKM. All the while teaching us useless things like mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. And people wonder why I don't like formal education. 

Before I go further, I want to define PKM so that we are on the same page. There is a simple formula that will help you understand...

PKM = PIM + PLM

Personal Knowledge Management = Personal Information Management + Personal Learning Management

These are two types of information that can go into your PKM System...

- **Learning** - something you learned that you might need to recall later. For eg. the concept of impostor syndrome.
- **Personal Information** - something you'll need in your personal life. For eg. something your friend would like as a gift.

## Learning

This is the traditional way of using PKM - for knowledge management. When people use the phrase 'Personal Knowledge Management' or PKM, this is what they generally refer to.

We'll be using the [[030 - Zettelkasten]] system for this. Zettelkasten works as an external support system for your thinking process. The **main point of Zettelkasten is not better notes - its better thinking. Some type of externalization improves your thinking** greatly - be it paper and pen, mind-maps, text editor, anything - as long as it's outside your brain. Unlike other note taking systems, the Zettelkasten process forces you to actually think while creating notes - this will let you better understand and remember the concepts that you learn.

We'll go into depths of Zettelkasten in a later chapter, but for now, lets focus on just the practical aspects.

When you learn a new thing, create a new note in your Zettelkasten vault. Ideally connected to some other notes in your vault.

If you have just one vault, you can have a section in your daily journal called learnings - and add a link to the new information that you learned there. This can show you how much your learning rate is - how many items are there in your learning section every day. Examples...

```
### Learnings

- [[Impostor Syndrome]]
- [[Dunning Kruger Effect]]
```

Linking is done using the **\[\[WikiLink\]\] format**. Just put **two square brackets(`[[`** and **`]]`) around the name of the note** you want to link to. If you want to link to a note called 'Zettelkasten', the link will look like this - `[[Zettelkasten]]`. In the above examples, both Impostor Syndrome and Dunning Kruger Effect are linked to their respective notes.

In the next chapter, we will be going into Zettelkasten at a bit more depth.

## Personal Information

This is information you are getting that will be useful in your personal life later. This could be...

- Deadline for a project you are doing
- Plans for a upcoming trip.
- Things that happened yesterday that you want to remember
- Gift ideas for a friend.
- Etc. It can by practically anything you want to record.

When you encounter a new price of personal information, you can add it to your journal. Eg...

`When I met [[John]] today, he said he needed a Bluetooth speaker. I should get him one as a gift for his birthday on [[2023-01-01 Sunday]]`

This way, we'll see this information when we open up John's page - or on his birthday(the two places we linked). If we link 'gift', we can see all the gift ideas in one place.

This comes more into the PIM(Personal Information Management) space - but we are using PKM tools and systems to do it.

You can put this information directly into the page about the information as well. In this example, instead of creating a journal entry, you could open up John's page and put an new line saying 'Gift Idea: Bluetooth Speaker'.

There is no one standard process to use for this, so we'll looking into a process I developed - [[040 - Graph Journal]] in the upcoming chapters.

## PKM

More than just its components, Personal Knowledge Management is **a collection of processes to manage the information we learn**. You can use these processes to manage any information you want. But we generally use it for PIM and PLM. At a high level, these processes can be categorized as...

- Capturing information
- Managing captured knowledge
- Using the knowledge

At a lower level, there are more parts...

- Finding information
- Capture/store information
- Classify, categorize, curate captured information. At this stage information becomes knowledge.
- Search captured knowledge
- Retrieve knowledge
- Communicate/Publish knowledge
- Use knowledge

In the next few chapters(yeah, this is NOT a small topic), I'll be going into depth for each of these aspects. But before I do that, I want to cover a few things that PKM is NOT about.

## Tacit and Explicit Knowledge

There are **two types of knowledge - tacit and explicit**. Tacit knowledge is, by definition, difficult to articulate. It's the experiences you have accumulated, it's the intuitions you have. A good example is how you know how to ride a bicycle. You can do it easily - but there is no way to explain it to someone else and have them pick up the skill. They have to build that knowledge by actually doing it. This type of knowledge cannot be codified. It can be learned only through observation, imitation and practice - not by reading about it.

Explicit knowledge is, thankfully, more explicit. This can be articulated, codified, stored and accessed later. Think of this as written knowledge. This is in the domain of PKM.

Explicit knowledge can be stored in your memory, or in books, or digitally. I'll be focusing on the digital aspects - but I will go into the other aspects as well. There are many advantages of the digital option over the other methods...

- **Perfect retention** - what you store is exactly what you get even if you go through it after decades. Human memory is bad at this. Even worse, there is a chance that you will have a blatantly [wrong memory](https://mindos.in/thinking-flaws/false-memory) that you are very confident about.
- **Searchability** - You can search through your entire knowledge base in seconds as long as you have stored them in a decently built system.
- **Backup and Redundancy**
- **Publish** - You can publish your knowledge. This will build you credibility. Also, you'll get other people to look at your content and give feedback - I cannot stress how useful this is.
- **Ubiquity** - as long as it's stored in a standard method, you can access it through your laptop or phone or other available devices. Having access to all your knowledge on demand is a critical feature. Brains are better at this - but retention quality will be worse with brain memory.
- **Collaboration** - you can work with other people easily
- **Tooling** - you have a huge list of existing workflows, apps, methods that you can adopt.
- And many more - like support for multiple mediums(text, images, videos), ease of knowledge transfer, etc.

Even after all that, brain memory still has a huge part to play in PKM. Knowledge cannot be personal until it has passed through your brain. PKM does not eliminate the need for thinking. It just **makes the thinking more efficient**. It's a thinking aid. PKM tools - be it digital or analog - can aid the process, or even supercharge the process. But ultimately, it's the brain that has to do the thinking.

Finally, there are books. I hate this system - but that does not disqualify it. There are many people who swear by the effectiveness of using physical mediums as thinking tools - ie. writing in books. I'll elaborate more on this in a later article.

This book is not new knowledge that you should acquire, but rather a new habit that you should build. And those are difficult to sell.

---

We have too much information coming at us. Its almost like wading through heavy winds. We interact with information(the wind in our analogy), but only enough to move forward. The rush impedes our movement. 

But if we learn to use it well, its like having wings. You can access the right informational stream, and use it to fly.
