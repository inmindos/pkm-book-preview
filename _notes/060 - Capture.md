The first part of the [[090 - PKM Flywheel]] is capturing information. Its the learning part - it is where input happens. There is four parts to this...

- Encounter
- Decision
- Capture
- Integration

## Encounter

This is the stage where we encounter new information that we might need later. We'll need a process that lets us move to the next stages. 

We can encounter new information in multiple circumstances...

- Pull: When we try to bring information to us(eg. Searching for a specific topic)
- Push: When someone pushes the information to us(eg. Email)

Another mode that we find information is...

- Active: We are actively trying to learn
- Passive: We encounter information when we are 

| | Active | Passive |
|---|---|---|
| Push | Email, RSS Feeds | Push notification on phone, Browsing Twitter |
| Pull | Google Search, Browsing Hacker news | Podcast when driving |

The source of the information might be internal as well. We might have an insight that needs to be captured. This can happen anytime - a popular time for this is in the shower! The capture system should be able to accommodate such instances as well.

## Decide

We have a lot of information coming our way. Its not practical - or recommended to save all of it to our vault. Saving everything will overload your system. You have to intentionally decide what information you want in your vault.

 These questions will help you make the decision.
 
- Will this help any of the projects I'm currently working on?
- Do I see a specific use case for this in the next 3 months?
- Is this a concept that want to study more about?
- Does this resonate with me?

## Capture

No mater which mode, which circumstances, once you make the decision that you need that piece of information in your vault, you should have a system to capture the information.

Active mode is easy - we'll have some mechanism to capture it. If you are searching for information on your laptop, its easy to capture the information in your vault. Because the vault will be on your laptop as well - and usually just an Alt+Tab away.

You'll have to build the habit of doing the capture - that will involve some effort. But the mechanism of capture is easy.

Passive is more tricky. You might not be in front of your laptop. But chances are you will have your phone with you. Even if your vault is there on your phone, chances are you might want to compose the note before you enter it in. Here, I'd recommend a temporary storage system to capture these 'fleeting notes'. I use Google Keep for this.

If you have such a temporary inbox, you'll need a system of review where you have move these notes to a more permanent version in your PKM vault. What works for me is a weekly review system when I open Google Notes and see what new note is still relevant. If I decide it should go into the PKM, I create a note for it in the vault.

The fleeting notes generally have very basic information. It can be just a few words or a couple of sentences. This is just a memory aid - not necessarily the entire note.

Another type of 'fleeting note' is bookmarking. When you come across a interesting article you can bookmark it or highlight parts of it. As long as your process involves going through the bookmarks or highlights and creating a note in your vault.

Everything you have captured should be moved to the main vault at some point. Only information in the vault is considered part of your PKM.

When you capture, capture the context as well. Make sure you have the source of the information. Maybe some other details like which project this information is for, any specific reason you thought this information interesting, etc.

## Integrate

Now that the information is part of your knowledge base, the next step is to integrate it better. This means linking it to other notes in the vault, tagging it, etc. This will make it easier to find this information when you are looking for it the next time.

If the note you want to integrate is personal information, the easiest way is to add it in today's journal entry. Eg. `When I met [[John]] today, he said he needed a Bluetooth speaker. I should get him one as a gift for his birthday`. More specific things can be added directly to the note itself. Eg. Open the `John` note, add this detail in it.

If the new note is some learning you had, you should add it to your Zettelkasten. To integrate it well, you'll have to think how this new information relates to your existing knowledge base. You can use these questions to help find such links...

- Does it refer to any concepts you have notes on?
- How does this idea fit into what I already know?
- What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
- Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

There will be times when you won't find any links. Those notes will be orphan notes. Hopefully you find links to it in the future when you add more notes. But if you don't find links, make sure you are doing this process of searching for links. That will make connections in your brain as well - which might be more useful.

        -   This is my research process...
            -   Open multiple sources about the topic.
            -   Read it one by one
            -   Coping over relevant information into a text editor/word document/etc.
            -   Once done, format and clean up the document you just made.
            -   Add that note to my knowledge base.
    -   Other options for capture
        -   Highlighting
            -   Diigo
            -   Highlight
        -   Readwise
        -   Instapaper
